  <p>You're so far, yet so close. You're so far, you live 229 kilometers away from me, that's 416 of your morning walks to school or approximately 71 of the walk we did the morning when we first met in person. But that's awful, I wish I didn't have to wait weeks, let alone months before seeing the girl I love. I wish every morning when I woke up I knew I just had to tilt my head slightly to the right to see heaven. Some could argue we are far apart, but we know we aren't. I feel close to you, a closeness I never felt with anyone else, a closeness that aspires for more, more of you, more of your soul, more of what makes you yourself. We're so close because we share so much and have so much in common.</p>
  <p>So close yet so far but in those moments I just know how lucky I am to have you at all.</p>

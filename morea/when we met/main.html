  <p>I never really told you this, or I mentioned, but I didn't tell the whole story because when I was in it, it was too soon to tell and after it, I didn't have the occasion to, so here it is. When we met, my everyday life changed so fast. It was so fast that my day was rithmed by your texts, and before I kept looking at my phone, waiting for your response. It was so fast indeed, that I am able to say it was too fast. I don't know why, I got hooked on you so fast and so hard. I remember a day, the day you went to the river with your friends, it was so soon after we knew each other, but still I missed you so much during that day, I had some sorts of emotional breakouts thinking about you and missing you. I also remember you mentioning that I blew up your phone so much angie was confused, I had to stop myself from texting you more than I did. Instincts or lucky coin-flip, it doesn't matter, now I have you and I love you Morea. </p>

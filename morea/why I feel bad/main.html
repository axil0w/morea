  <p>I took some time to try and understand why I feel bad, even pissed off when you are, even if it is for a joke. After taking everything into consideration, I believe that it is because seeing you that way makes me sad, or it makes me empathic at least. I have always had a very interlinked relationship between the anger and sadness within me. Unable to process these both, they can manifest as the other one and vice-versa. Today when I saw you down, I was unable to see it was fake, because my brain doesn't care about that, it only cares about the fact that the girl I love is mad and it triggers a reaction within me. I'd like to own up to my toxic ways of being and say I also feel pissed off because I feel like it is my responsability, and I'm unable to process that in the moment, unable to deal with the consequences of my actions. I could say, but im not sure, that I also feel pissed off at myself for that and project that. I am writing this today so you can better understand me, what is going on inside of my brain, even when I can't myself. I hope you understand that by opening myself to you, making you see the mechanisms inside my brains, I am making myself vulnerable. But I do that because I trust you, I know you are not gonna break that trust nor going to use that against me. Today I wrote you this message because it is important to me that you understand myself as much as I do and why i react certain ways, because only after, we will be able to evolve and continue the path of our lives, together.</p>

  <p>I know it's late, and I know you've probably been waiting for your advent calendar surprise. But the truth is I dont know what to talk about today, all I know is you influence my emotions so much you have no idea. Today I don't feel down, but I dont feel at my best, but I know it probably is because we didn't have much time to talk today, and when im not with you, I usally feel alone. Im sorry to leave a not so joiyful note today, but I had to, for the sake of keeping those messages truthful. I know right now I might feel down, but my day will be saved when I'll talk to you. And I couldn't find anything better to talk about so im speeding myself up to write this message because I saw your reply and im so excited to talk to you.</p>
  <p>Love, Nathan</p>

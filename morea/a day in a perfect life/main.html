  <p>How I would imagine a day in a perfect life. I would wake up, Saturday morning, a warm light would lightly wake us up, taking us back from the trance of sleeping together. I would wake up with your skin against mine, I would see your cute face as you sleep. You would wake up, smiling from seeing me, and I would tweak from that. We would wake up, take our time. I would feel your whole body under my fingertips, that way my senses would wake up. I would massage you if you needed. We would have sex, if we felt like it. Then we would make breakfast, with music, we would make something tasty: toast, eggs, shakes, and maybe bagels if we feel fancy. We would take a shower together, we would dance like the silly couple we are. Then we would prepare and go walk hand in hand in Central Park, admiring birds and nature. We would then head back home, watch a couple of episodes of the series we are watching together. We would discuss the people's choices and judge them, say which ones we like, which we don't. After that, I'll take you to a Vietnamese restaurant, the one where some of our friends swear they have the best ph√¥. We would then each have plans with some of the rare friends we don't share that day. We would then come back home around 7 p.m., and we would go to the gym together. We would have a good workout together, even though I would have death-stared someone who glanced in your direction, only to check if the machine was taken. We would come back home and eat something lazy, because we will be, of course. We would play together, I would make fun of your skills and destroy you. We would then take a bath together, with foam and bath bombs. The scent would be amazing. I would poke your ass with my feet because I find that funny and you would be like "Aledddddd tu fais quoii" and we would laugh our asses off. We would play with the foam like kids, I'll make a beard with it while you put it on top of your head. We would then do our skincare, get in bed and, if we felt like it, have sex. We would then sleep in each other's arms. That is, in my eyes, a perfect day. I could find a thousand with you, I don't think I could find one without you.</p>

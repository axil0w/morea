  <p>I got a weird feeling yesterday, I was going to the meeting I had with my professor and while I was walking I thought about, like lots of time. This time I thought about you younger, how you grew up and even how you changed since I got the chance to have you in my life. I thought about you as a kid, your childhood, which ultimately led to mine. I could help but have that weird feeling of at the same time sadness and curiosity. Sadness because I didn't get to know you then, I didn't get to see what life had to offer before so late, I didn't get to see you giving a speech in front of your school, not to comfort you after, I didn't get to see you trying guitar the first time, I didn't get to dance with you (good for you I would've probably been one of those boys in love with you). I didn't get to help you in your tough times, bet there for you. But curiosity also, first of all because I'm wondering how life would've been like but also and mostly because I see how much we change each other, why you, I'm sure I would've been a completely different person by now. </p>

  <p>Today, I decided to just let my mind flow and follow with my writting wherever it leads me. I just feel so safe with you, I know I can be vulnerable with you, I can be totally myself, you don't judge me. I love that in you. Everyday, I create little scenarios of us doing cute things in my head, I let them flow, and it just makes my day better, I love those scenarios, they make me feel so safe. I feel so safe when you baby me, I just stop thinking about everything and let my body relax on your chest while you rub my head. I love babying you too, making you feel safe and sleepy, I love when you sleep on my chest, I wish it could be like that everyday. Im looking at my desk and I'm seeing a photo of you, you know the photo you gave me in your letter, the one we thought would never come. You look so cute, I love that you didn't try to be any different then you are. I love your authenticity, you are not afraid to be yourself and I wouldn't want you any different. You look so damn cute in that photo, and I am realising now that you're wearing the blue bracelet I have on me now. I love that photo even more now. You know the letter you gave, the second one, everyday the itch of opening it when I see it comes to me, I really want to know what's inside of it, I need to know, but I'm keeping it, as you asked for a time where I'll miss you unbearably, I hope I won't always postpone that because there will always be a time I'll miss you more. I miss you so much when I can't talk to you, when I have free time and you aren't here to fill it, I just wish you could. I miss you right now so I'm sorry I'll stop writing that message and come speak with you on the phone.</p>
  <p>With love, your Nathan</p>
